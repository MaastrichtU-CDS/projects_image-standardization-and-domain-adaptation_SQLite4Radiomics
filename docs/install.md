# Installation
1. Clone the git repository with

```
git clone https://github.com/Maastro-CDS-Imaging-Group/SQLite4Radiomics.git
```


2. Go to the folder `radiomicsfeatureextractionpipeline` and run the `Setup.bat` file. This will make sure that:

* The paths that Conquest uses, matches the current location on your machine

* Creates the necessary virtual environment and installs the necessary python packages

* Installs necessary node packages

You should see a command prompt window pop up and go through the installation of the necessary packages.

If when running this file, the command prompt window immediately closes after execution (no package installation could be seen), then check the Troubleshooting section below.
